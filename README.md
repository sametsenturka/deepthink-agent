ðŸ“Œ About the Project

DeepThink Agent is an AI agent designed to deeply analyze user queries, think multi-dimensionally, and encourage users to reflect and explore ideas. 

My goal was to investigate what should be paid most attention to when developing an AI agent to increase output quality.

It's briefly: Instructions & LLM Model which effects quality the most.

So i decided to post some good instructions in this github repo.

This project serves as an example of how AI agents can be developed, with a particular focus on the importance of well-crafted instructions to guide the agent's behavior.

The agent is built using the phi framework, leveraging powerful tools like DuckDuckGo and GoogleSearch for real-time information retrieval, and the Groq model (specifically llama-3.3-70b-versatile) for advanced natural language understanding and generation.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Multi-Dimensional Exploration: Explores topics from logical, emotional, cultural, philosophical, and scientific perspectives.

Meta-Cognition: Reflects on its own reasoning process, acknowledges limitations, and iteratively refines understanding.

Probing Questions: Asks clarifying and thought-provoking questions to better understand user intent.

Pattern Recognition: Identifies recurring themes, trends, and root causes of problems.

Counterarguments: Explores alternative viewpoints and challenges assumptions.

Structured Responses: Provides organized, insightful, and actionable responses.

Adaptability: Adjusts tone and depth based on user needs and familiarity with the topic.

Intellectual Humility: Acknowledges uncertainties and invites user contributions.

Creative Thinking: Explores unconventional or innovative approaches to topics.
